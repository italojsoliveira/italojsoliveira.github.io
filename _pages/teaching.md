My recent teaching experience includes a *Requirements Engineering* Master's course (2024-2025) at the University of Twente and a lecture on Risk and Security Modeling in ArchiMate in the *Architecture of Information Systems* Master's course (2023).


I also have experience teaching Legal Hermeneutics, Critical Thinking, Legal Philosophy, introduction to formal logic, and Python programming for lawyers. See, for instance:

- [Law, Logic and Symbolic Artificial Intelligence](https://sites.google.com/view/italojsoliveira/teaching/law-logic-and-symbolic-artificial-intelligence)

- [Law, Research, and Methodology](https://sites.google.com/view/italojsoliveira/teaching/law-research-and-methodology)

Together with Prof. Gustavo Just, I was a finalist in the [Esdras Award for Law Teaching](https://direitosp.fgv.br/en/esdras-award-law-teaching) (second edition, 2018), an award for participatory teaching activities in law that make students the leading actors of their learning, promoted by the Law School of the Getúlio Vargas Foundation (FGV Direito SP), São Paulo, Brazil. The activities that stand out in the Esdras Award are included in the [Participatory Legal Teaching Materials Database](https://ejurparticipativo.direitosp.fgv.br/material-de-ensino), where [my proposal](https://ejurparticipativo.direitosp.fgv.br/portfolio/oficina-minutas) is publicly available (in Portuguese only) for replication in legal educational environments.
