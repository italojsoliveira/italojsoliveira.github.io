I have experience teaching themes related to Legal Hermeneutics, Critical Thinking, Legal Philosophy, basics of formal logic, and programming (in Python) for lawyers. See, for instance:

- [Law, Logic and Symbolic Artificial Intelligence](https://sites.google.com/view/italojsoliveira/teaching/law-logic-and-symbolic-artificial-intelligence)

- [Law, Research and Methodology](https://sites.google.com/view/italojsoliveira/teaching/law-research-and-methodology)
