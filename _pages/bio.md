My full name is "√çtalo Jos√© da Silva Oliveira", but I sign my scientific publications as "√çtalo Oliveira" only.üôÇ


With a background as a Lawyer, Law Teacher, and Researcher in Philosophy of Law, I decided to pursue a career in Computer Science, believing information technology is taking over every aspect of society and every research field.

- I obtained a Doctor in Law degree at the Federal University of Pernambuco, Brazil.

### 2018

- I was a [Research Fellow](https://direitorio.fgv.br/fellows-rio) at the Law School of the Get√∫lio Vargas Foundation (FGV Direito Rio), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in the context of the fellowship program "Fellows in Rio" (2018).
