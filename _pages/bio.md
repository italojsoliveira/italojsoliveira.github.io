My full name is "Ítalo José da Silva Oliveira", but I sign my scientific publications as "Ítalo Oliveira" only.🙂


With a background as a Lawyer, Law Teacher, and Researcher in the Philosophy of Law, fascinated by mathematical logic, which I met due to my philosophy studies in law school, I decided to pursue a career in Computer Science, believing information technology is taking over every aspect of society and every research field.

I have always been persistent in chasing my goals. However, I have been extremely fortunate to meet incredible and kind people without whom I would not have achieved anything.


### 2024

- I obtained a PhD in Computer Science from the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, Italy🇮🇹, researching ontology-driven conceptual modeling applied to the security domain, under the supervision of [Enrico Franconi](https://www.inf.unibz.it/~franconi/), [Giancarlo Guizzardi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giancarlo_Guizzardi), and [Tiago Prince Sales](https://people.utwente.nl/t.princesales).
