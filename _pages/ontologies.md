## [A Formal Theory of Prevention](https://purl.org/prevention-ontology)

Built as a module of the Unified Foundational Ontology, this proposal describes the dynamics of events that prevent other events from happening. A complete formalization of this theory is in progress.


## [ROSE: Reference Ontology for Security Engineering](https://purl.org/security-ontology)

ROSE is a well-founded reference ontology, specified in OntoUML modeling language, that characterizes the concept of security mechanism and explains how this notion is related to value, risk, and prevention. Two major applications of ROSE are:

- [An Ontological Analysis and Redesign of the D3FEND Cybersecurity Model](https://purl.org/d3fend-analysis)

- [An Ontological Approach to Risk and Security Modeling in ArchiMate](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10005209)


## [PHATO: A Phishing Attack Ontology](https://purl.org/phishing-ontology)

PHATO is a well-founded Phishing Attack Ontology, specified in OntoUML modeling language, built by reusing the Reference Ontology for Security Engineering (ROSE).

## [PAPO: A Phishing Attack Process Ontology](http://w3id.org/phishing-process-ontology/git)

PHATO is an evolution of PHATO. It is a well-founded core ontology that aims to characterizes the process of phishing attack incidents.
